Welcome to the Guildhall
=========

A place for a guild of @ShrimpingIt facilitators to agree best practice on kit preparation and workshop design to teach learners how to prototype devices.


# What is 'shrimping' ?

We coined the word 'shrimping' to describe our improvised hacking practice. The focus; helping learners get started on physical computing by documenting projects which are ___accessible___ for them.

These days it is trivial to create objects which have ___minds of their own___! You can source the bits for pennies and the magical knowledge isn't guarded by a secret cabal, but instead is sprawled [all over the internet](http://start.shrimping.it/arduino.html). So why isn't everyone doing it, all the time? Our answer; because it isn't accessible to most people.

So what does ___accessible___ really mean? We've broken this down into at least three dimensions

* ___comprehension___
* ___availability___
* ___cost___

Many people think that [@ShrimpingIt](http://shrimping.it) is all about creating Arduino projects for education which are cheap. However, cost is probably the least important dimension. This may surprise people, but we've often rejected opportunities to save money on kits, to benefit the other two critical principles.

## Controversies and Consensus

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus for how views on use of stripboard, choice of jumper wires vs solid core, battleships coordinates and other controversies might be settled.
