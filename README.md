guildhall
=========

A place for a guild of @ShrimpingIt facilitators to agree best practice on kit preparation and workshop design to teach learners how to prototype devices.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus for how views on use of stripboard, choice of jumper wires vs solid core, battleships coordinates and other controversies might be settled.
